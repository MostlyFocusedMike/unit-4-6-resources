# Modify Rubric

## What's the goal of Modify?
Going from 0 to 60 and 60 to 100 are two different skills sets. Students need to feel comfortable dropping into existing features and making enhancements. Instead of a simpler Has Many, the Modify prompt builds on top of a Many to Many. The two features they are being asked to add incorporate the classes on either side, so they'll need to understand the relationships well.
