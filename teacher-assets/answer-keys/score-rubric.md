# Score Rubric

## Test scores
For this assignment, there are the following test scores:

From Scratch: 13 points
Modify: 4 points
Debug: 3 points

For a total of 20 possible points

## Short answer scores
And there are 3 short questions, max 3 points each. To see the point value breakdown, check out the [short-answers-rubric.md](./short-answers-rubric.md)

For a total of 9 possible points.

## Calculating the scores
As a shortcut, check the [assignments/test-score.json](../assignments/../../assignments/test-score.json) file for the individual scores and add them to the manually calculated short answer score. Once you have that number, check below for the final spirit score.

  0   = 0
1 -10 = 1
10-20 = 2
20-25 = 3
25-29 = 4

## That's a lot of counting and math
Ideally we'll automate the score tabulation soon! We already have a prototype for the tests.
